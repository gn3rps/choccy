These are the default QMK files that the Choccy comes pre-flashed with. 

## How to flash new QMK files (such as keymaps) to the Choccy:

The Choccy is configured to use QMK's bootmagic lite feature for easy flashing. The flashing process is as follows:

  Step 1
  Ensure QMK is installed on your computer (see the [QMK Getting Started documentation](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/newbs_getting_started.md)).
  
  **Step 2**
  With the Choccy unplugged press and hold the outer thumb key on one half, then plug a USB-C data cable connected to the host computer into the controller on that half of the Choccy.
  
  3.) Continue to hold the thumb key down for 3-5 seconds after the controller is plugged in and the green LED on the controller illuminates. Release the thumb key; the controller should now be in bootloader mode (it should be visible as a drive in your file explorer or Finder on MacOS).
  
  4.)

Please note that the default keymap is configured for MacOS use and minor changes will need to be made for use with other operating systems.
