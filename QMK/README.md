These are the default QMK files that the Choccy comes pre-flashed with. 

## How to flash new QMK files (such as keymaps) to the Choccy:

The Choccy is configured to use QMK's bootmagic lite feature for easy flashing. The flashing process is as follows:

  1) Ensure QMK is installed on your computer (see the [QMK Getting Started documentation](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/newbs_getting_started.md))

Please note that the default keymap is configured for MacOS use and minor changes will need to be made for use with other operating systems.
