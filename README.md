Meet the sprengBoard Choccy - an ergonomic split 60-key mechanical keyboard designed for Choc (v1) switches. The Choccy has the following features:

* Designed for Kailh Choc (v1) switches
* Switches are spaced for Choc-specific keycaps (slightly smaller than MX-size keycaps)
* 1U pinky stagger
* Two thumb keys + three modifiers per half (or vice-versa)
* Reversible PCB w/ SMT diodes
* Supports both Kailh hotswap switch sockets and direct solder
* Support for up to two rotary encoders (one per half), or an additional standard key (note: this key is not hotswappable and must be soldered)
* USB-C connection to computer
* TRRS (3.5mm) cable for communication between halves
* Designed to use [Adafruit's KB2040 Kee Boar Driver](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5302) (based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU)
* Powered by [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk)
